# Heart-Disease-Prediction-with-ML-Classification-Models

## Project Description
This project focuses on building and evaluating classification models to predict the presence and severity of heart disease based on a dataset containing various patient attributes. The primary goal is to explore different machine learning algorithms and a manual data preprocessing approach to determine which features are most indicative of heart disease and how well different models perform on this task.

## Tech Stack
*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the analysis and model building.
*   **pandas:** Used for data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and data handling.
*   **Matplotlib:** Used for creating static visualizations.
*   **Seaborn:** Used for creating informative statistical graphics based on Matplotlib.
*   **kagglehub:** Used to download the dataset directly from Kaggle.
*   **scikit-learn:** Used for data preprocessing (imputation, scaling, encoding), model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN), and evaluation (classification report, confusion matrix).
*   **Google Colab:** The environment where the notebook was developed and executed.

## How to Run
1.  **Open the notebook in Google Colab:** Upload or open the notebook file (`.ipynb`) in your Google Colab environment.
2.  **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. If running in a new Colab environment, you can install them using pip (refer to the `requirements.txt` file).
3.  **Run all cells:** Execute all the code cells in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. This will perform the data loading, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generate visualizations.
